A fork of PlotSquared by Ruinscraft.

## Goal
The goal of PlotCubed is to modify PlotSquared to suit the needs of Ruinscraft. Changes to PlotSquared upstream should begin with a comment ``// PlotCubed start`` and end with a comment ``// PlotCubed end``, including additional source files.

## Additional Feature Set
- Plot warps
- Plot timers
- Plot broadcasts
- Teleport to a random plot
- BossBar API
- (WIP) Scoreboard API
- (WIP) Plot roles system
- Minor PlotSquared tweaks/fixes
